# Purpose

This is a helper script that loads all necessary packages to run the targets
pipeline, then runs it to acquire Landsat Collection 2 surface reflectance and
surface temperature for user-defined areas of interest (AOI). While this script
is written in an .Rmd script, we recommend walking through this script manually,
as the knit function often runs into issues and this script has a number of
interactive steps.

We have a user guide which describes all the steps in this (and the lakeSR)
workflow which [is available
here](https://aquasat.github.io/AquaMatch_lakeSR/index.html). We strongly
reccommend reading through the user guide if you are using data that result from
this pipeline.

## Pre-requisites

siteSR_WQP relies on a configuration file (`config.yml`) to run specific
profiles that determine what operations are being run. The file contains two
configuration profiles: "default" and "admin_update".

-   "default" runs the pipeline using publicly-stable versions of datasets from
    a previously run pipeline. It requires a Google email address to complete
    the pipeline

-   "admin_update" is intended for use by ROSSyndicate members when updating
    siteSR datasets, creating publicly-stable versions of siteSR to be
    stored in the AquaMatch_siteSR repository.

This pipeline does not apply handoff coefficients between Landsat missions,
which are imperative for analyzing the data that overlap multiple sensors. See
the [user guide section on
handoffs](https://aquasat.github.io/AquaMatch_lakeSR/define-handoff.html) for
additional guidance on this matter.

Proper configuration of harmonize_repo_directory and lakeSR_repo_directory is
imperative as the siteSR workflow references files inside
AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP and AquaMatch_lakeSR file structures. If this is
incorrectly set up, users will receive a message to communicate this and the
workflow will stop. All repositories stored on the AquaMatch GitHub will
contain files that link to versions of the data that the AquaMatch team has
harmonized so that a local run is not necessitated. Any run of the "default"
configuration will require that the harmonize pipeline has been run locally.

## Install necessary packages

```{r package_installer, echo = F}
package_installer <- function(x) {
  if (x %in% installed.packages()) {
    print(paste0("{", x ,"} package is already installed."))
    } else {
      install.packages(x)
      print(paste0("{", x ,"} package has been installed."))
    }
  }
```

List packages that need to be checked for install, and walk the function along
them all.

```{r walk_package_installer, message = F}
packages <- c("arrow",
              "config",
              "crew",
              "nhdplusTools",
              "polylabelr",
              "reticulate",
              "rmapshaper",
              "sf", 
              "tarchetypes",
              "targets",
              "tidyverse",
              "xml2",
              "yaml")

lapply(packages, package_installer)
```

## Authenticate and initialize Earth Engine

If you have used the default configuration, you will not need to follow these
steps. If you have set the general configuration file (`config.yml`) arguments
of `run_pekel` or \`run_GEE\` to TRUE, you will need to have [installed and
initialized the `gcloud CLI`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and
have a [Google Earth Engine
account](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register) prior to running this
workflow. Some common troubleshooting solutions [can be found
here]<https://github.com/rossyndicate/ROSS_RS_mini_tools/blob/main/helps/CommonIssues.md>).

### Authentication

To authenticate your GEE account, we will use a Python environment created in
the R file 'src/py/pySetup.R'. This will take a few minutes if you haven't yet
run the python setup script while it creates a virtual environment.

```{r}
source("python/pySetup.R")
```

### Authenticate your instance of GEE

```{python}
import ee

ee.Authenticate(auth_mode = "localhost")
```

## Run the targets pipeline and output a network graph.

```{r run_targets, echo = F}
library(targets)

# for the purposes of this document, we comment out the following lines, as they may take a long time to run depending on configuration settings. 

# tar_make()

# tar_visnetwork()
```
