#' @title Check to see if point is completely contained within path-row
#' 
#' @description
#' Using a set of points with lat/lon, and the unique pathrows associated with them,
#' add WRS pathrow information to the locations file, remove buffered points that
#' are not completely within the path row geometry. Buffer is defined in the yaml file.
#' 
#' @param WRS_pathrows list of pathrows to iterate over
#' @param locations dataframe of location
#' @param yaml contents of the yaml .csv file
#' 
#' @returns returns a dataframe of points and buffer that are fully contained by
#' a single pathrow with the id/lat/lon/PR information
#' 
#' @note
#' This step will result in more rows than the locations file, because a single 
#' location in space can fall into multiple pathrows.
